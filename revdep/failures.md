    Unexported objects imported by ':::' calls:
      'BiocGenerics:::replaceSlots' 'Biostrings:::XString'
      'IRanges:::.valid.CompressedList' 'IRanges:::coerceToCompressedList'
      'S4Vectors:::.valid.DataFrame' 'S4Vectors:::labeledLine'
      'S4Vectors:::make_zero_col_DataFrame'
      'S4Vectors:::prepare_objects_to_bind'
      See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
    There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
      almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects:
      '.get_inosine_score'
    ```
