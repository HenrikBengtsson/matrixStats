# matrixStats: Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to Vectors)

The matrixStats package provides highly optimized functions for
computing common summaries over rows and columns of matrices,
e.g. `rowQuantiles()`. There are also functions that operate on vectors,
e.g. `logSumExp()`. Their implementations strive to minimize both memory
usage and processing time. They are often remarkably faster compared
to good old `apply()` solutions. The calculations are mostly implemented
in C, which allow us to optimize beyond what is possible to do in
plain R. The package installs out-of-the-box on all common operating
systems, including Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Example
With a matrix
```r
> x <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 500), nrow = 20, ncol = 500)
```
it is [many times
faster](http://www.jottr.org/2015/01/matrixStats-0.13.1.html) to
calculate medians column by column using
```r
> mu <- matrixStats::colMedians(x)
```
than using
```r
> mu <- apply(x, MARGIN = 2, FUN = median)
```

Moreover, if performing calculations on a subset of rows and/or
columns, using
```r
> mu <- colMedians(x, rows = 33:158, cols = 1001:3000)
```
is much faster and more memory efficient than
```r
> mu <- apply(x[33:158, 1001:3000], MARGIN = 2, FUN = median)
```



## Benchmarks
For formal benchmarking of matrixStats functions relative to
alternatives, see the [Benchmark reports](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats/wiki/Benchmark-reports).

## Installation
R package matrixStats is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixStats) and can be installed in R as:
```r
install.packages('matrixStats')
```

### Pre-release version

To install the pre-release version that is available in Git branch `develop` on GitHub, use:
```r
remotes::install_github('HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats@develop')
```
This will install the package from source.  Because of this and because this package also compiles native code, Windows users need to have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed and macOS users need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.




## Contributions

This Git repository uses the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model (the [`git flow`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) extension is useful for this).  The [`develop`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats/tree/develop) branch contains the latest contributions and other code that will appear in the next release, and the [`master`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats) branch contains the code of the latest release, which is exactly what is currently on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixStats).

Contributing to this package is easy.  Just send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  When you send your PR, make sure `develop` is the destination branch on the [matrixStats repository](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats).  Your PR should pass `R CMD check --as-cran`, which will also be checked by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats">Travis CI</a> and <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HenrikBengtsson/matrixstats">AppVeyor CI</a> when the PR is submitted.
