/***************************************************************************
 HISTORY:
2014-11-07 [HB]
  o ROBUSTNESS: Added protection for integer overflow in bin counts.
2014-11-06 [HB]
  o CLEANUP: Moving away from R data types in low-level C functions.
2014-10-01 [HB]
  o BUG FIX: binMeans() returned 0.0 instead of NA_real_ for empty bins.
2014-04-04 [HB]
  o BUG FIX: The native code of binMeans(x, bx) would try to access
    an out-of-bounds value of argument 'y' iff 'x' contained elements
    that are left of all bins in 'bx'.  This bug had no impact on the
    results and since no assignment was done it should also not crash/
    core dump R.  This was discovered thanks to new memtests (ASAN and
    valgrind) provided by CRAN.
 2013-10-08 [HB]
  o Created template for binMeans_<L|R>() to create functions that
    bin either by [u,v) or (u,v].
 2013-05-10 [HB]
  o SPEEDUP: binMeans() no longer tests in every iteration (=for every
    data point) whether the last bin has been reached or not.
 2012-10-10 [HB]
  o BUG FIX: binMeans() would return random/garbage means/counts for
    bins that were beyond the last data point.
  o BUG FIX: In some cases binMeans() could try to go past the last bin.
 2012-10-03 [HB]
  o Created binMeans(), which was adopted from from code proposed by
    Martin Morgan (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle) as
    a reply to HB's R-devel thread 'Fastest non-overlapping binning mean
    function out there?' on Oct 3, 2012.
