## Introduction

The matrixStats package provides highly optimized functions for
computing common summaries over rows and columns of matrices,
e.g. `rowQuantiles()`. There are also functions that operate on vectors,
e.g. `logSumExp()`. Their implementations strive to minimize both memory
usage and processing time. They are often remarkably faster compared
to good old `apply()` solutions. The calculations are mostly implemented
in C, which allow us to optimize beyond what is possible to do in
plain R. The package installs out-of-the-box on all common operating
systems, including Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Example
With a matrix
```r
> x <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 500), nrow = 20, ncol = 500)
```
it is [many times
faster](http://www.jottr.org/2015/01/matrixStats-0.13.1.html) to
calculate medians column by column using
```r
> mu <- matrixStats::colMedians(x)
```
than using
```r
> mu <- apply(x, MARGIN = 2, FUN = median)
```

Moreover, if performing calculations on a subset of rows and/or
columns, using
```r
> mu <- colMedians(x, rows = 33:158, cols = 1001:3000)
```
is much faster and more memory efficient than
```r
> mu <- apply(x[33:158, 1001:3000], MARGIN = 2, FUN = median)
```



## Benchmarks
For formal benchmarking of matrixStats functions relative to
alternatives, see the [Benchmark reports](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/matrixStats/wiki/Benchmark-reports).
